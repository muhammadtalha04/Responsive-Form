# Responsive Form

In this project I created a replica of the form given in ***exampleForm.png*** file. I used HTML5 and CSS to design this form. The webpage is responsive in design and to make it responsive I used CSS Grids and media queries.

To test this project, download **index.html** and **style.css** files and place them in the same directory. After that just open the **index.html** file in your browser to view the webpage.
